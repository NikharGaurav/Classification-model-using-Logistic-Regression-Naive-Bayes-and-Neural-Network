Implemented Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes and Neural Network to predict the probability of Green Card approval based on given features.
Please follow the below instructions for succesfull execution
1. dataProcessing.R - Imports the data, and makes the dataset ready for further processing
2. shuffle_data_main.py - Shuffles the data for neural network
3. functions.py - has all functions, for neural network
3. Looper.py - runs models and creates accuracy and other metrices for neural network
4. Naive Bayes.py - runs model for Naive Bayes
5. Logistic_Regression.py - runs model for Logistic Regression
